This section covers the fundamental design principles of the GenAI for Unreal plugin. Understanding these concepts will help you use the plugin effectively and avoid common pitfalls.

---

## 1. Finding and Using Plugin Nodes

The plugin follows a consistent naming convention to make its features easily discoverable.

#### In Blueprints

All asynchronous Blueprint nodes start with **"Request"** followed by the provider and the service. You can find any function by simply searching for this pattern in the Blueprint context menu.

- `Request OpenAI Chat Completion`
- `Request Google Text To Speech`
- `Request Anthropic Chat Stream`

     </figure>
</div>

#### In C++

The static C++ functions follow a similar pattern, typically starting with **"Send"**.

- `UGenOAIChat::SendChatRequest(...)`
- `UGenGoogleTTS::SendTextToSpeechRequest(...)`
- `UGenAnthropicChatStream::SendStreamChatRequest(...)`

## 2. Unified Settings Structs & Model Selection

Every API request is configured using a dedicated **Settings struct** (e.g., `FGenOAIChatSettings`). In Blueprints, you use a **"Make..."** node to create these structs. With the latest update, you now have two powerful ways to select a model:

### The Dropdown Node (Recommended)

For convenience and to prevent typos, the plugin now includes advanced **"Make..." nodes with a fire logo**. These nodes feature a dropdown menu that is dynamically populated with all the known supported models for that provider. This is the easiest and recommended way to select a model.

<div class="image-wrapper">
    <figure>
        <img src="[PLACEHOLDER: Image of the new fire-logo 'Make' node showing the model dropdown]" alt="Advanced Make Node with Dropdown" style="width: 100%;">
        <figcaption class="image-caption">
            The advanced "Make..." node provides a convenient dropdown for model selection.
        </figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>

### The String Input Node

For maximum flexibility, the standard **"Make..." node** is still available. This node allows you to specify a model by typing its exact API ID into the `Model (String)` or `Custom Model Name` input field. This is useful for:
- Using a brand-new model that hasn't been added to the dropdown yet.
- Dynamically selecting a model at runtime based on a variable.

> **Important:** The string input will always override the enum dropdown if both are set.

## 3. Asynchronous by Design

All API calls in this plugin are **asynchronous** (non-blocking). This is essential to prevent your game from freezing while it waits for a response from a web server. The workflow is always:

1. You call a function to send a request.
2. You provide a **callback delegate** (in C++) or connect to an **event pin** (in Blueprints).
3. Your game continues running without interruption.
4. When the response arrives, your callback function or event is executed with the result.

---

## 4. Automatic Lifetime Management

A critical challenge in Unreal with asynchronous operations is **Object Lifetime**. If an Actor is destroyed while a request is still in-flight, the callback can try to access invalid memory, causing a crash. The plugin solves this automatically for you.

#### Blueprint Solution: Built-in Safety

Blueprint nodes are built on `UCancellableAsyncAction` and are inherently safe. They use weak pointers to track the calling object and will automatically skip the callback if the object has been destroyed.

#### C++ Solution: Developer-Managed Safety

When calling the static C++ functions, you are responsible for managing lifetime. The required pattern is to capture a `TWeakObjectPtr` in your callback lambda.

```cpp
// Essential C++ safety pattern
void AMyActor::RequestData()
{
    TWeakObjectPtr<AMyActor> WeakThis(this);
    UGenOAIChat::SendChatRequest(Settings, Messages,
        FOnChatCompletionResponse::CreateLambda([WeakThis](/*...params...*/)
        {
            // CRITICAL: Always check if the object is still valid.
            if (!WeakThis.IsValid()) return;
            WeakThis->HandleResponse(/*...params...*/);
        })
    );
}
```

## 5. Extended Debug Mode

To help with troubleshooting, the plugin now includes an **Extended Logging Mode**. When enabled, every API request and response will be printed to the Unreal output log.

- **What it Logs:** The full request body (including headers and parameters) and the full response from the server.
- **Security:** To prevent log spam and protect data, any `base64` encoded strings (typically used for images) will be truncated in the log output.
- **How to Enable:**
    1. Go to **Project Settings > Plugins > GenAI Plugin**.
    2. Find the **"Enable Extended Logging Mode"** checkbox and enable it.

This is an invaluable tool for debugging issues with your API calls without needing external network monitoring tools.

## 6. Dynamic Model Discovery (`Get All Models`)

The plugin now provides a function to fetch a list of all available models directly from the provider's API. This is perfect for building UIs that let users choose from the most up-to-date model list.

- **Blueprint Node:** `Request Get All [Provider] Models` (e.g., `Request Get All OpenAI Models`).
- **C++ Function:** `UGenOAIModels::SendListModelsRequest(...)`.

This feature is demonstrated in the new example projects to populate the model selection dropdowns in the UMG widgets.
