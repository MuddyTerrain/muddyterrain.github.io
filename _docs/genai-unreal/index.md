## Why GenAI for Unreal?

GenAI for Unreal is more than just a tool—it's a complete solution designed to make advanced AI integration seamless, secure, and scalable.

* **Unified and Simplified API**

  Say goodbye to writing boilerplate code for multiple AI services. Our plugin provides a single, intuitive API that works across OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, XAI, and Google Gemini. You can switch between providers with minimal code changes, allowing you to choose the best model for the job without vendor lock-in.

* **Full Blueprint & C++ Support**

  We believe in empowering the entire development team. The plugin offers feature parity between Blueprints and C++, with self-managing asynchronous nodes that handle complex operations like network requests and response handling. This ensures that both engineers and designers can build and iterate on AI features with ease.

* **Built for Real-time Experiences**

  Create truly interactive and immersive worlds with features like real-time text streaming for dynamic dialogue, multimodal vision support for analyzing in-game scenes, and structured JSON output for complex game logic. These tools are designed for the high-performance demands of modern games.

* **Secure Key Storing**

  Security is a top priority. GenAI for Unreal includes a robust system for secure API key management that avoids storing sensitive information in plain text. For larger teams, our optional proxy support provides an additional layer of security and centralized control over API access.

* **Cross-Platform and Future-Proof**

  Built with standard Unreal Engine modules, the plugin is designed for seamless cross-platform compatibility. As the AI landscape evolves, we are committed to providing continuous updates, ensuring you always have access to the latest models and features.
