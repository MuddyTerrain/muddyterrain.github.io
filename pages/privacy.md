Welcome to Muddy Terrain Games Private Limited ("we," "our," or "us"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you visit our website at muddyterrain.com, download our games, or interact with our services.

By using our website or services, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this privacy policy. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, please do not access or use our services.

## 1. Information We Collect

We collect information from you in several ways when you interact with our website and services.

**Information you provide directly to us:** When you contact us through our website contact form or send us an email, we collect your name, email address, and any message content you provide. We also keep records of our correspondence with you for customer support purposes.

**Information collected automatically:** When you visit our website, we automatically collect certain technical information about your visit. This includes your IP address, browser type and version, operating system, the pages you visit on our site, how long you spend on each page, the website that referred you to us, and your general geographic location (country or region level). We collect this information through cookies and similar tracking technologies.

**Game analytics:** Our games are distributed through third-party platforms including Epic Games Store, Fab.com, Steam, Apple App Store, Google Play Store, and other digital distribution platforms. When you download, purchase, or play our games through these platforms, we may receive aggregated, anonymized analytics data about how our games are played. This helps us improve our games and develop new features. Your personal information is handled according to the respective platform's privacy policy, and we do not directly collect personal information through our games unless explicitly stated within the game.

We want to be clear about what we don't collect. We do not collect sensitive personal information such as financial data, health information, government identifiers, or biometric data. We also do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect for several legitimate business purposes that help us provide and improve our services.

We use your contact information to respond to your inquiries, provide customer support, and communicate with you about our games and services. When you contact us with questions or technical issues, we use your information to troubleshoot problems and provide assistance.

The technical information we collect about your website visits helps us understand how people use our site so we can improve its functionality, design, and content. We analyze website traffic patterns to identify popular content and optimize the user experience.

We may use your email address to send you information about our games, updates, and new releases, but only if you have given us permission to do so. You can opt out of these communications at any time by following the unsubscribe instructions in our emails or contacting us directly.

We also use information to comply with legal obligations, protect our rights and the rights of others, and ensure the security of our website and services.

## 3. Legal Basis for Processing

For users in the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, and Switzerland, we process your personal data based on several legal grounds under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). We process information with your consent when you have given us specific permission, such as when you subscribe to our newsletter or contact us voluntarily. We also process information based on our legitimate interests in operating our business, providing customer support, improving our website and games, and communicating with our users. When required by law, we may process information to comply with legal obligations or to protect vital interests.

For users in other jurisdictions, we process information as necessary to provide our services, comply with applicable laws, and pursue our legitimate business interests while respecting your privacy rights under local data protection laws.

## 4. Information Sharing

We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes. We only share your information in limited circumstances that are necessary for our business operations or required by law.

We work with trusted service providers who help us operate our website and business. This includes web hosting services that keep our website running, Google Analytics which helps us understand website traffic, email services for customer communications, and cloud storage providers for secure data storage. These service providers are contractually required to protect your information and only use it for the specific services they provide to us.

We may disclose your information when required by law or when we believe disclosure is necessary to comply with legal processes, court orders, or government requests. We may also share information to protect our rights, property, or safety, or that of our users or others, to investigate potential illegal activities, or to enforce our terms of service.

In the event of a business transaction such as a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction, but it would remain subject to the same privacy protections outlined in this policy.

We may share aggregated, anonymized data that cannot identify you personally for research, business development, or marketing purposes.

## 5. Cookies and Tracking Technologies

Our website uses cookies and similar technologies to enhance your browsing experience and help us understand how our site is used. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your device when you visit our website.

We use essential cookies that are necessary for basic website functionality, such as remembering your preferences and maintaining security. We also use analytics cookies through Google Analytics to help us understand how visitors interact with our website, including which pages are most popular and how long people spend on different sections. This information helps us improve our content and user experience.

Our website may include social media features and plugins that could collect information about your interactions with those features. These are governed by the privacy policies of the respective social media platforms.

You can control cookies through your browser settings and choose to block or delete cookies at any time. However, please note that disabling certain cookies may affect the functionality of our website. You can also opt out of Google Analytics tracking by visiting https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.

## 6. Data Retention

We retain your personal information only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy policy or as required by law.

Contact form submissions and email communications are kept until your inquiry is resolved and for a reasonable period thereafter to maintain our customer support records. Website analytics data is retained according to our Google Analytics settings, typically for 26 months. We may retain certain information longer when required by applicable laws, such as tax and accounting regulations.

When we no longer need your personal information, we securely delete or anonymize it to protect your privacy.

## 7. Data Security

We take the security of your personal information seriously and implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect it against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction.

Our technical safeguards include encryption of data during transmission and storage, secure server configurations with regular security updates, access controls that limit who can view your information, and regular security monitoring to detect and respond to potential threats.

We also maintain organizational safeguards including employee training on data protection principles, strict access policies that ensure personal information is only accessed on a need-to-know basis, regular review and updating of our security policies, and established procedures for responding to any security incidents.

While we implement strong security measures, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. We cannot promise absolute security, but we are committed to protecting your information using industry-standard practices.

## 8. Your Privacy Rights

You have several rights regarding your personal information, and we are committed to helping you exercise these rights.

All users, regardless of location, have the right to request access to the personal information we hold about you, to request correction of any inaccurate information, and to request deletion of your personal information. You can also opt out of marketing communications at any time.

If you are located in the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, or Switzerland, you have additional rights under GDPR including the right to receive your data in a portable format, to object to processing based on legitimate interests, to request restriction of processing, and to withdraw consent at any time where we rely on consent. You also have the right to complain to your local data protection authority if you believe we have not handled your personal information properly.

California residents have rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) including the right to know what personal information is collected about you, the right to request deletion of your personal information, and the right to opt out of any sale or sharing of personal information. We do not sell personal information as defined by the CCPA.

Residents of Australia and New Zealand have rights under their respective Privacy Acts, including rights to access and correct personal information and to make complaints to the relevant privacy commissioners.

To exercise any of these rights, please contact us using the information provided at the end of this policy. We will respond to your request within the timeframes required by applicable law.

## 9. Children's Privacy

Our services are not directed to children under 13 years of age, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. While our games may be suitable for various age groups, we rely on the age verification systems of the platforms where our games are distributed.

If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under 13 without proper parental consent, we will take immediate steps to delete that information. If you are a parent or guardian and believe we may have collected information from your child, please contact us immediately so we can address the situation.

## 10. International Data Transfers

Your information may be transferred to and processed in countries other than your country of residence, including countries that may have different data protection laws. When we transfer your information internationally, we ensure appropriate safeguards are in place to protect your privacy.

For transfers from the European Economic Area, we rely on adequacy decisions by the European Commission where available, or implement appropriate safeguards such as Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission. We also ensure that our service providers maintain appropriate security measures regardless of where they are located.

## 11. Third-Party Services and Platforms

Our games are available on various digital distribution platforms, each with their own privacy policies. When you download or purchase our games through these platforms, your information is handled according to their privacy policies. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of Epic Games Store/Fab.com, Steam, Apple App Store, Google Play Store, and any other platforms where you access our games.

Our website may contain links to third-party websites that are not operated by us. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these external sites and encourage you to review their privacy policies before providing any personal information.

## 12. Artificial Intelligence and Automated Processing

As part of our game development process, we may use artificial intelligence tools to create game content and improve gameplay mechanics. We also use automated systems to analyze website usage patterns and assist with customer support responses, although human oversight is always maintained for important communications.

We do not make automated decisions that would significantly affect you without human involvement. If our practices change in this regard, we will update this privacy policy and provide you with appropriate information and choices.

## 13. Updates to This Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices, technology, legal requirements, or other factors. When we make changes, we will update the "Last updated" date at the top of this policy.

For significant changes that materially affect your rights, we will provide prominent notice on our website and, where we have your email address, we may notify you directly. We encourage you to review this privacy policy periodically to stay informed about how we protect your information.

Your continued use of our services after any changes to this privacy policy constitutes acceptance of those changes.
