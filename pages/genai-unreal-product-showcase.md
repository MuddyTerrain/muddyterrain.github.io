# GEnAI for Unreal: Integrate Advanced AI into Your Games

**Tired of tracking a new AI model launch every day? Say no more.**

**Supercharge your Unreal Engine projects with the GEnAI plugin, bringing the power of cutting-edge generative AI directly into your game development workflow.**

"Gen AI for Unreal" lets you focus on the game layer, while we take care of the LLM integration. The plugin supports all current cutting-edge LLM APIs like OpenAI's GPT-4o, Anthropic's Claude Sonnet/Opus, Google's Gemini 2.5 flash/pro, XAI's Grok, and Deepseek's R1 and so on. Focus on creating immersive experiences while GEnAI handles the complex integration of leading AI models. This plugin provides a streamlined, long-term solution for accessing a wide array of generative AI capabilities, perfect for indie developers and established studios alike.

## Key Features:

*   **Structured Output:** ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•
    *   For example, getting JSON responses of 100 AI-generated NPCs each with their own stories, race, gender, name, etc. Leverage OpenAI's capability to receive structured JSON data, making AI responses easier to parse and use in your game logic.
*   **Chat Completion:** ü§ñ
    *   Can be used for NPC dialogue systems, story generation, and so many other parts of the gameplay. Access models from OpenAI (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini), Anthropic (Claude series), Google (Gemini series), XAI (Grok), and DeepSeek (DeepSeek-V3).
*   **Reasoning Models:** üß†
    *   Currently supports Deepseek's famous R1, and other advanced reasoning models (like those accessible via OpenAI APIs) which can be used to generate more core narrative parts of the project.
*   **Multi-Modal Input:** üì∏
    *   Supports giving images or files as input too for the model (e.g., with Claude, GPT-4o Vision). Can be used for various game cases like for example taking the screensnap for player view once a while and let the AI assistant guide the player on where to go next, etc.
*   **Image Generation:** üñºÔ∏è
    *   Supports OpenAI's Image generation including DALL-E and also the famous GPT-4o's image generation capabilities.
*   **Text To Speech:** üîä
    *   Can be used to generate game dialogue or narration or live conversation with LLM enabled AI NPC bots using OpenAI's TTS models.
*   **Audio Transcriptions:** üìù
    *   Can be used to convert audio into text (e.g., OpenAI Whisper), which can be used for live conversations, voice commands, and etc.

## Unlock New Creative Possibilities:

*   **Dynamic NPCs:** Create characters that can understand and respond to players in natural language.
*   **Procedural Content Generation:** Use AI to generate in-game items, lore, dialogue, textures, and more.
*   **Enhanced Player Interaction:** Implement voice commands, transcriptions, or allow players to interact with the game world using images.
*   **AI-Assisted Development:** Speed up your workflow by using AI for code generation, asset description, or brainstorming.
*   **Innovative Gameplay Mechanics:** Design novel gameplay loops based on AI-driven events and emergent behaviors.
