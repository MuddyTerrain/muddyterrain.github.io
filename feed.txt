You're asking the right question. You can't reliably filter traffic with iCloud Private Relay using IP addresses. The correct way to handle this is to use a browser-based method that sends a special parameter to Google Analytics from your device, regardless of what your IP address is.

The most common and effective method is to use a special link to "tag" your browser as internal.

Hereâ€™s the concept:

You visit a special URL on your own site one time, like www.yourwebsite.com/?traffic_type=internal.

Code on your website (best implemented via Google Tag Manager) sees this parameter and sets a persistent cookie in your browser.

From then on, every time you visit your site from that browser, the code checks for the cookie. If the cookie exists, it automatically attaches the traffic_type: 'internal' parameter to your GA4 data.

This way, Google Analytics identifies your browser as internal, not your IP address.

How to Implement This (High-Level Steps)
This process is typically set up using Google Tag Manager (GTM), as it doesn't require you to edit your website's code directly.

Create a Variable in GTM: Set up a variable that captures the traffic_type parameter from the URL.

Create a Cookie-Setting Tag: Create a tag that fires only when it sees traffic_type=internal in the URL. Its job is to set a first-party cookie in your browser (e.g., named internal_user with a value of true).

Create a Cookie Variable: Create another variable in GTM that reads the value of the internal_user cookie you just created.

Modify Your GA4 Tag: In your main Google Analytics 4 Configuration tag, add a field to set:

Parameter Name: traffic_type

Value: {{Your Cookie Variable}} (This will be internal if the cookie is set).

Once this is configured, you just need to visit yourwebsite.com/?traffic_type=internal once on each device/browser you use. From that point on, you will be correctly flagged as internal traffic until the cookie expires or is cleared.
